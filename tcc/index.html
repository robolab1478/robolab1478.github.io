					<p><strong>iPREVENT</strong> is aimed at reducing the need of the <a href="https://www.epipen.com/" target="_blank" class="lime-text text-accent-4">EpiPen</a>. Capitalism has taken over the brains of <a href="http://www.mylan.com/" target="_blank" class="lime-text text-accent-4">Mylan</a>, so they're charging outstanding prices for these life-changing pens. The problem with EpiPens is there a one-and-done tool - once you use it once, you <em>have</em> to buy another one! The goal of iPREVENT is simple - reduce the number of times you need to use an EpiPen. Our idea is engineered to be simple - take a drop of our specially formulated non-toxic allergen indicator, and place it in / on a food item that you're worried could allergen. Based on the presence of the allergen, it will change colors, using the universal red is bad and green is good color scheme. iPREVENT helps people with allergies have a peace of mind. We understand that there's a lot of risk for people with food allergies when eating food that <em>you</em> haven't prepared. Other people don't make food with your allergies in mind, or they don't know what to use in replacement of it. With iPREVENT, we want to give you the freedom to enjoy food, without worrying something terrible's going to happen.</p>
					<p>You might have heard of <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-engineering-researchers-test-241465" target="_blank" class="lime-text text-accent-4">iTube</a>, which is similar to the concept of iPREVENT. However, iTube and iPREVENT are nothing alike. iPREVENT is designed to be simple, but more importantly, <em>fast</em> and <em>easy</em>. iTube claims to be able to determine the presence of allergens in <em>20 minutes</em>, with a long list of things to do (including using <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> to determine if an allergen is present)! Our goal is to produce a product that can tell you in seconds, <em>and</em> to be extremely simple - drop it on your food, wait and see. </p>
					<p>We plan on using $7500 of the $20,000 we want to raise for iPREVENT. This will give us access to some of the leading scientists and product developers throughout the United States, as well as the capital required to produce the first batch of this preventative serum.</p>

					<p><strong>NoteQuest</strong> is a collaborative website of class notes for core classes. It will be updated daily as new notes become available. In order to ensure that the notes are of the highest quality, both in terms of correctness and understandability, students will pay a monthly membership fee, but have access to all of the notes online. The goal of Note Quest is to aid in the process of studying and reduce stress for people that have to miss class. College students know the struggle of communicating with professors, especially if they end up not coming to class last minute (for example, if they're sick). This problem is magnified for professors who are unwilling to help remedy the problem.</p>
					<img src="notequest.png" class="materialboxed responsive-img" alt="NoteQuest - it's a process" width="100%" data-caption="NoteQuest - How it makes a difference"/>
					<p>NoteQuest isn't the first tool like this in the industry. There are sites such as StudyBlue and Quizlet that let you make flashcards, which are, in the end the most important things you need to know for class. There is also a site called OneClass that does something similar. However, OneClass is highly criticized for accepting low quality submissions. NoteQuest is different, because the membership fee ensures that only the highest quality notes are available to our members.</p>
					<p>We plan on spending $4500 of the $20,000 we want to raise for NoteQuest. This will give us access to the developers needed to create the website and apps, as well as hosting and getting the first set of notes uploaded.</p>

					<p><strong>Spot Swap</strong> is an app where people trade parking spots. It's based on the idea of mutualism - you do something for me, I'll do something for you, and is ideal in places like college campuses. The idea behind it is simple - parking lots are really full, and it takes a while to walk to your car. We want to fix this solution with Spot Swap. When you're looking to leave from your location (for example, Rudder Tower), you tell Spot Swap where you are and where you parked (i.e lot 74). Someone looking to park in lot 74 will tell Spot Swap, and Spot Swap will match you up. The person looking for a lot will give you a ride from Rudder to Lot 74, in exchange for your parking space (since you're leaving). It's a win-win situation!</p>
					<img src="spotswap.png" class="materialboxed responsive-img" alt="Spot Swap flowchart" width="100%" data-caption="How SpotSwap works"/>
					<p>Spot Swap is a free valet service. We're able to provide it freely by having a person with a need (a parking spot) do something (give you a ride) in exchange for it. It's what used to be called bartering!</p>
					<p>We plan on spending $8000 of the $20,000 we want to raise for Spot Swap. This will cover the cost of hosting, as well as the developers to create the matching algorithm and provide the features.</p>

					<p>Here at Real Bedtime Champs, we take your money seriously. For that reason, we have a <a href="./business_model_team_26.pdf" target="_blank" class="lime-text text-accent-4">business model</a> for iPREVENT, since it's the most expensive innovation. Feel free to peruse it if that's your style! We've also compiled a <a href="./product_catalogue_team_26.pdf" target="_blank" class="lime-text text-accent-4">catalogue</a> of our innovations if you want to print this out or something.</p>
					<p>Thanks for taking the time to look at the great innovations we've been working on. If you want, feel free to email us (because that's a great, secure form of communication we can use) through eCampus. If you liked any of our ideas, please feel free to <a href="#footer" class="smoothscroll lime-text text-accent-4">donate</a>!</p>
